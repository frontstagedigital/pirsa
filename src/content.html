            <p>When we launched the public beta of the NSW Design System in December 2018, we had no idea that what we delivered as a test-and-learn product would become one of the most talked about whole of government projects in NSW. </p>
            <p>Our upcoming plans for scaling the NSW Design System are addressing the following friction points our users are facing when delivering digital products and services.</p>
    
            <ol>
              <li>Teams with less digital experience within government that are thirsty for knowledge, guidance and a community to help support them delivering digital things.</li>
              <li>High digital capability teams who wanted to share what they’ve learned, collaborate and contribute back to reduce design and development time and cost as teams build the same components over and over.</li>
              <li>External service providers delivering products and services for government agencies needing direction and approval on style, brand, templates, patterns and reusable components.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Our research has shown what is possible in the delivery of digital products and services across whole of government. We’re excited to take these learnings to the next stage of service delivery. Watch this space!</p>
