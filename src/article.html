                <p class="nsw-intro">As the Easter long weekend approaches, the Department of Primary Industries and Regions (PIRSA) is urging all travellers to leave restricted produce behind and help protect the Riverland’s vital horticulture industry from fruit fly.</p>

                <p>As the Easter long weekend approaches, the Department of Primary Industries and Regions (PIRSA) is urging all travellers – particularly those entering South Australia from interstate – to leave restricted produce behind and help protect the Riverland’s vital horticulture industry from fruit fly.</p>
                <p>With thousands of people expected to drive from Victoria and other states into the Riverland, PIRSA is stepping up its presence at quarantine stations and key border entry points, including along the South Australian–Victorian border.</p>
                <p>Jason Size, Incident Controller for PIRSA’s Fruit Fly Emergency Response, said that the increased movement of people and food over Easter presents a serious risk.</p>
                <p>“We haven’t seen any new Queensland fruit fly outbreaks in the Riverland for more than two months, which is great news,” Mr Size said. “But this Easter is a critical moment. With more travellers heading into South Australia – many visiting families, bringing food, or heading to the Riverland – we’re urging everyone: don’t bring in fruit or vegetables.”</p>
                <p>Quarantine officers will be conducting random roadside checks and vehicle inspections, and travellers caught carrying restricted fruit or vegetables face on-the-spot fines of $417.</p>
                <p>“To avoid a fine and help protect local growers, just do one simple thing: leave your fruit and veg at home. If you’ve packed any by mistake, eat it before the border or use one of the many quarantine bins located on major highways,” Mr Size said.</p>
                <p>Even shop-bought fruit and vegetables are not permitted to be brought into the Riverland from outside the region – whether they’re home-grown, purchased in another state, or carried as a snack.</p>
                <p>Instead, PIRSA encourages all visitors to shop local after arriving in the Riverland, supporting growers and ensuring fresh, safe produce.</p>
                <p>“If you’re travelling with home-grown produce, prepare it properly before you go – or better yet, enjoy it at home. We’ve even shared some great recipe ideas online so you can preserve or cook your fruit safely before travelling,” Mr. Size added.</p>
